This is a repository for my personal blog, where I'm using Flask (Python) as the web framework.

TO USE:
* Download files in this structure:

.\
├── templates\
│ ... ├── blog.html\
│ ... ├── home.html\
│ ... └── etc. (all html files)\
├── static\
│...├── styles\
| ... | ... └── style.css\
│ ... └── etc. (image files)\
└── main.py

// Note: I have not included images I have used in the website but they will go in the 'static' folder marked.

* Run main.py
* Website can be found on 0.0.0.0:5000 by any device on the network (if firewall access is allowed)
