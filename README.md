This is a repository for my personal blog, where I'm using Flask (Python) as the web framework.

TO USE:
- Download files in this structure:

[Parent folder]
| main.py
| templates
  | [all html files]
| static
  | styles
    | style.css
// Note: I have not included images I have used in the website but they will go in the 'static' folder.

- Run main.py
- Website can be found on 0.0.0.0:5000 by any device on the network (if firewall access is allowed)
